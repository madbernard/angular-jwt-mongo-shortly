# angular-jwt-mongo-shortly

A version of bit.ly done as a single page application (SPA) with Angular, JSON web tokens (JWT) to track logged-in users, and MongoDB/Mongoose for a database. I completed this project as a student at Hack Reactor, while pairing with [@delphinefoo](https://github.com/delphinefoo).
